# Cyber Sentinel
## `I believe most of the vulnerabilities, not just the technical ones, can be patched with proper requirements specification.`
Cyber Sentinel is a PHP/MySQL web application made intentionally vulnerable! This project aims to increase awareness about common yet dangerous vulnerabilities.  
This application allows the user to exploit some beginner-level vulnerabilities by themselves. Tutorials are provided to learn about:
- The vulnerability 
- How it can be exploited 
- The part of the code causing this vulnerability.
- How to patch this vulnerability at different levels.

### Installation
To set up this application on Windows, you must run Apache and MySQL services, which are inbuilt in XAMPP.  
Follow this for setting up Cyber Sentinel on [Windows](https://suchitreddi.github.io/cybersentinel/docs/setupw.html).  
After setting up and downloading the repository, rename the folder to `cybersentinel` and place it inside htdocs folder of XAMPP.
You can also download the dockerized version of the application here, which will require you to download the Docker Desktop application for Windows. 
Follow the steps in this Docker Hub repository to use this application on [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/5herl0ck/cybersentinel).

### For users
There are different vulnerabilities with different difficulty levels. The difficulty levels are based on how good the patch is for that specific vulnerability. There is no fixed objective to complete a module. If you feel you've exploited the system thoroughly, the goal is reached! There is a help button at the bottom to view hints & tips for that vulnerability. There are additional links for further reading on each vulnerability.<br>

### For developers
- Refer CONTRIBUTING.md and DEVELOPMENT.md.

## Disclaimer
I do not take responsibility for how anyone uses this application (Cyber Sentinel). I have made the purposes of the application clear, and it should not be used maliciously. I have warned and taken measures to prevent users from installing Cyber Sentinel on live web servers.<br>
If any web server is compromised via installing Cyber Sentinel, it is not my responsibility. It is the responsibility of the person/s who uploaded and installed it.<br>
This application is vulnerable! There are documented vulnerabilities that will cause more undocumented ones. So, it is strictly advised `not` to use it directly on your host machine without any virtual machine or docker. Do not host code from this project on internet-facing servers, as that will compromise them.
