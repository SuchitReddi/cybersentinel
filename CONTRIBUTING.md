# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with me before making a change.

I am not doing this project commercially. So, let's keep things informal and real.

Documentation is present in the "docs" folder. I will make a seperate file DEVELOPMENT.md explaining the project's code part.

Before creating an issue, check for existing issues and discussions.

## Code of Conduct

I could have just copied a template here, but let's keep it simple. Don't be a bully. No one likes bullies.
