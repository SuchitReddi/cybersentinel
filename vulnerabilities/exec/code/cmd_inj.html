        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Command Injection - Intro</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size:25px;">
            Command injection is an attack in which the goal is to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating
            system via a vulnerable application. This is possible when an application passes unsafe user input data
            (forms, cookies, HTTP headers) to a system shell.
            This attack is possible largely due to insufficient input validation.<br><br>
            All the tasks you perform on your computer can be done using the terminal. The first computers were
            completely controlled only using terminals (CMD)! There was no GUI.<br><br>
            But, humans prefer to make things easier. So, GUI gained in popularity.<br><br>
            Some of the basic commands are ping, ifconfig, dir (ls), etc. Many web applications call OS processes
            directly and use the command line interface (CLI).<br><br>
            The CLI is very powerful, so you have to control how much power want to give to the user. This can be done
            by securely constructing the command strings.
