    <h1>DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting - Intro</h1> <!--center-->
    <p style="font-size:25px;">
        Cross-Site scripting redirects users of a vulnerable web application to a malicious site. This attack doesn't target the application directly, but the its users.<br><br>
        Web applications of famous companies like British Airways, Fortnite, eBay were vulnerable to XSS in the past.<br><br>
        Imagine that you visited a popular website (something like Amazon, Google). You trust the brand name and believe that the website you're visiting is authentic. But what if it is a very detailed knock off!<br><br>
        XSS makes these types of situations a reality.
