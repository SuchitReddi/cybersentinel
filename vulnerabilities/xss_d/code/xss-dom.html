        <h1>DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting - Intro</h1>
        <p style="font-size:25px;">
            DOM (Document Object Model) is an API for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of
            documents, and how they are accessed and manipulated.<br><br>
            In XSS-DOM (also called “type-0 XSS”), the attack payload is executed by modifying the DOM “environment” in
            the victim's browser used by the original client side script, so that the client side code runs in an
            “unexpected” manner. That is, the page itself (HTTP response) does not change, but the client side code
            contained in the page executes differently due to the malicious modifications that have occurred in the DOM
            environment.<br><br>
            This is in contrast to other XSS attacks (stored or reflected), where the attack payload is placed in the
            response page (due to a server side flaw).<br><br>
            Cross-Site scripting redirects users of a vulnerable web application to a malicious site. This attack
            doesn't target the application directly, but the its users.<br><br>
            Web applications of famous companies like British Airways, Fortnite, eBay were vulnerable to XSS in the
            past.<br><br>
            Imagine that you visited a popular website (something like Amazon, Google). You trust the brand name and
            believe that the website you're visiting is authentic. But what if it is a just a very carefully crafted
            look alike! XSS makes these types of situations a reality.<br><br>
