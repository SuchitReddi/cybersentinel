        <h1>Reflected Cross-Site Scripting - Intro</h1>
        <p style="font-size:25px;">
            Reflected XSS (also called “type-1 XSS”) occurs when an application receives data in an HTTP request and
            includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way. The attacker injects a malicious script
            into the unsanitized code, and crafts a malicious link which can reveal sensitive information like cookies.
            Then, this url is sent to the victim via external sources like mail.<br><br>
            This vulnerability exploits the trust placed in popular websites and applications by browsers and users.
            When a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link, the injected code travels to the vulnerable web
            site, which reflects the attack back to the user's browser. The browser then executes the code because it 
            came from a “trusted” server.<br><br>
            This vulenrability is most common, but very dangerous if left unattended. Many big companies like 
            Facebook, Twitter, Adobe, Uber, and Philips fell victim to Reflected XSS attacks.<br><br>            
            It's a non persistent attack, because it's carried out through a single request/response cycle, i.e,
            all it takes is a victim clicking on the malicious link.<br><br>
            This vulnerability is commonly found in site search engines. If the user input in the url doesn't escape
            HTML control characters, XSS flaws will ensue.<br><br>
