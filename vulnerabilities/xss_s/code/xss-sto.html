        <h1>Stored Cross-Site Scripting - Intro</h1>
        <p style="font-size:25px;">
            Stored XSS (also called second-order or persistent XSS) occurs when an application receives malicious script
            and stores it in the page's database in the form of HTTP requests used for comments section and such.<br><br>
            There is no way for the victim to know beforehand that this site has been breached!<br><br>
            As this malicious script is stored as a comment in the webpage, whenever a victim visits the page the whole 
            page loads, executing the malicious script for each victim visting the site.<br><br>
            The script needs to be injected into the site only once, but it doesn't stop executing until the database is
            cleared or reset, thus making it a persistent attack.<br><br>
            This vulnerability is commonly found in comments sections, chat message forums, visitor logs and such.<br><br>
