PERSISTANT

**The logs code in sentinelPage.inc.php, was causing too many redirects error preventing user from reaching setup.php.
I had to change code in many places which might cause database not found errors and no redirection to setup, if sentinel 
database is dropped and user is still in some page. (logs.php is having this issue).

**Checking for username existance and such**
The method used is to give a sql query to search for input username and check for it in a table. It uses mysql_num_rows==1.
But for now, it's possible to insert duplicate users, which is a intendend vulnerability (for auth bypass).
The logic mysql_num_rows==1, will not allow duplicate users to login, delete or anything. So we should use mysql_num_rows!=0, if we
want to introduce the vulnerability.
Various levels of login.php pages can be made to make it more tougher to create duplicate users in the future.
FIXED

**Do you already have another mysqld server running on port: 3306?**
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68065284/specified-port-3306-is-already-in-use-when-installing-mysql
This error occurs when you start xampp. Apache server started fine, but MySQL gave did not. When I opened the logs, I saw this:

Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in use
Do you already have another mysqld server running on port: 3306 ?
Aborting

To fix this error, follow these steps:
Go to services or task manager, you will find a service called mysql80 running, stop it. Then restart xampp.

**Uncaught mysqli_sql_exception: Unknown database 'sentinel' in some\path\sentinelPage.inc.php:512**
This error occurs when you try to open one of the vulnerabilities requring a database (Command Injection). The solution is simple,
you have to setup a database first. Go to Setup/Reset DB, there click on the "Create/Reset Database" button. You might need to scroll
down to see this button.

**Changes in github repo not reflected when git clone is used in docker**
When you are using the application as a docker image, you will be using git clone to get the repository into the docker.
But the newer changes are not being updated, atleast not instantly.
A temporary fix for this is:
You can go to exec inside the container using docker desktop application. Once there, run the below command.
cd app/cybersentinel && git pull
A better and more permanent fix would be to add the above command into the dockerfile and update the dockerhub repo.
I have to figure out how to do that when free.

**Database not selected**
I reintroduced the user table by changing disable_authentication to false in config.inc.php. Then to make the flow: any db requiring page,
setup, login; I had to make some changes. After that, the queries were not able to get the database name. So I added a statement before
lines having "$result = mysqli_query". The statement is "mysqli_select_db($GLOBALS["___mysqli_ston"], "sentinel" );".
To make the above statement accept variable db name, use this (may not always work, worked in login.php): 
"mysqli_select_db($GLOBALS["___mysqli_ston"],  $_SENTINEL[ 'db_database' ] );"

**Undefined global variable $___mysqli_ston in sentinelPage.inc.php**
This error occurs due to database not being initialized. Add this code to fix it: sentinelDatabaseConnect();

**Weak password hash**
This application uses md5($password), to hash the password. This is insecure. But as this application aims to be insecure, we go along with it.
If you want a more secure way, use this password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT).
