**Do you already have another mysqld server running on port: 3306?**
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68065284/specified-port-3306-is-already-in-use-when-installing-mysql
This error occurs when you start xampp. Apache server started fine, but MySQL gave did not. When I opened the logs, I saw this:

Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in use
Do you already have another mysqld server running on port: 3306 ?
Aborting

To fix this error, follow these steps:
Go to services or task manager, you will find a service called mysql80 running, stop it. Then restart xampp.

**Uncaught mysqli_sql_exception: Unknown database 'sentinel' in some\path\sentinelPage.inc.php:512**
This error occurs when you try to open one of the vulnerabilities requring a database (Command Injection). The solution is simple,
you have to setup a database first. Go to Setup/Reset DB, there click on the "Create/Reset Database" button. You might need to scroll
down to see this button.

**Changes in github repo not reflected when git clone is used in docker**
When you are using the application as a docker image, you will be using git clone to get the repository into the docker.
But the newer changes are not being updated, atleast not instantly.
A temporary fix for this is:
You can go to exec inside the container using docker desktop application. Once there, run the below command.
cd app/cybersentinel && git pull
A better and more permanent fix would be to add the above command into the dockerfile and update the dockerhub repo.
I have to figure out how to do that when free.

**Database not selected**
I reintroduced the user table by changing disable_authentication to false in config.inc.php. Then to make the flow: any db requiring page,
setup, login; I had to make some changes. After that, the queries were not able to get the database name. So I added a statement before
lines having "$result = mysqli_query". The statement is "mysqli_select_db($GLOBALS["___mysqli_ston"],  "sentinel" );".
To make the above statement accept variable db name, use this (may not always work, worked in login.php): 
"mysqli_select_db($GLOBALS["___mysqli_ston"],  $_SENTINEL[ 'db_database' ] );"
